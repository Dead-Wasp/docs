# Overview:

SS 14 is a remake. I think a remake should deepen or rework the ideas from the original. In space station 13 we have «a replica pod» that can revive dead person. But for that you need DNA of person, like blood. In most cases you don’t need replica pod because you have DNA for cloning and can just put body, brain or DNA samples in cloning pod , also you have defibrillator revival, surgical revival. AND, people don’t want play ugly grass people. This is why decide instead of replica pod made sunflowers. Sunflower common ghost role, and if you lost any ways to be revived, or you just don’t enter in round, you can pick cute sunflower for play. 

# Goals:
Add new plants what can give new scenario:
- add source of oil for botany
- add makeshift welding tool and source of fuel in case you can't get basic one.
- add new gost role for people who died and still want play.
- exclusive sunflower items can add more personality to each sunflower and allow them to help the station.

# Gameplay:

Basic sunflowers used to be source of oil, like in real life. Sunflowers will have to have 2 mutation ways. One is sentiflowers – sentient sunflowers, and meltingflower – a sunflower that can be used like makeshift welding tool and source of welding fuel.


 		Sentient sunflowers are used to be temporary replacement of crew members, and grass monkeys who do funny things. They have two arms for work, suit back slot for oxygen, belt for tools. Also have hat, suit, eyes, mask, ears slots. That enough to have a lot fun ways to play. In all slots except suit can be placed basic human stuff, in suit slot sunflowers get unique clothing’s and no one except sunflowers can wear this. So far, only the “Heliosphere” spacesuit is on this list. That spacesuit allows sunflowers work in space. And sunflowers now can be engineers and salvagers, or they can build own shuttle and explore space.


# balance issue:
I understand problems with balance. In nuke botany can mobilize vegetation for fight. If they also get death nettle it will be an invincible army. For fight with that I give sunflowers clumsy trait, they can’t shoot. Also, they don’t have hardsuit’s from start, RND need research repley for suit blueprint, but in nuke scenario RND research weapons. Also, each Heliosphere costume cost lot resources. Made a lot depressurization can counter PMCs PETALS. As sunflowers have less health, they can’t live in vacuum so long as humans.
And I think about give sunflower’s zombie immune, for fighting against zombies. That converts space station 14 in literally Plant’s vs Zombies. We know a lot about EA, and we don’t want have a sue.
